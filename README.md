# BosonSO


This codebase was developed in the summer of 2014 to simulate the time-evolution of self-organising Bose-Einstein condensates in driven optical cavities. 

Code written mainly in Fortran for maximum performance, with the numerical functionality provided by the powerful NAG suite of numerical libraries.
